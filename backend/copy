Hi Jasmin Ma'am,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Suryakant Tiwari, and I recently completed my B.Tech from NIT Bhopal. I am from Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.

I am pleased to inform you that I have been assigned to the PTA-Cash - TPRGaugeApp project, which is under your supervision. I wanted to introduce myself and let you know that I am one of the new graduates joining your project.

Additionally, I received a communication indicating that I should reach out to you for details regarding the work-from-home and office policies.

Looking forward to working with you.

Best regards,
Suryakant Tiwari
